# TVC v02 full-station plan

Era: heritage-led pre-redevelopment, approximately 2022. No proposed terminal blocks and no rolling stock. Geometry in metres; X along station, Y from entrance into yard. Full yard is not compressed to a presentation diorama.

## Evidence and coverage
- Preserve individually modelled dressed-granite heritage central pavilion and characteristic three upper front bays from 14 November 2022 photograph. Expand flanking building to the approximately 140 m map footprint; hidden wings reconstructed.
- OSM map API retrieved 8 October 2026 provides 46 railway ways, three platform polygons including the two islands tagged 2;3 and 4|5. Historic photos and five-platform official context support broad topology; current mapped coordinates are not a 2022 engineering survey. Exclude proposed subway. Retain mapped mainline, crossovers, all yard/siding centre lines, as editable path-based rail meshes. Don't silently renumber service roads.
- Track system: 1.676 m inner rail-head gauge, profiled rails, 0.6 m sleeper pitch, fastenings, ballast shoulders, switch blades, frog/guard/check rails, turnout drives/rodding, stop blocks at genuine dead-end siding nodes. Geometry inferred from mapped centreline connectivity, not approved railway point design.
- Station: all five platform faces at mapped full length, shelter structure with trusses/purlins/corrugation/bolts, coping and tactile strips, bins/benches/water coolers, kiosk stock, signs and coach displays, electrical cabinets, drainage and cable routes.
- Connective architecture: walkable heritage entrance into hall and Platform 1; two covered footbridges with stairs to the three physical platforms; circulation gaps around room furniture; separate reconstructed ticket/booking block plus office, waiting lounge, toilets, pantry and store. Door openings and interior lighting must be real.
- Surrounds: forecourt/drop-off street, kerbs, railings, station-side service paths, boundary wall, palms, nearby massing. Avoid anonymous empty presentation ground.
- Review: overall daylight, entire mapped yard top-down, heritage/forecourt, booking hall, waiting room, toilets, office, platform detail, turnout, maintenance yard, furnished roof-off overview. All from actual Blender renders.

2. Platform detail (same author/date): https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inside_view_of_Thiruvananthapuram_Central_railway_station.jpg — actual pixels inspected: dark asymmetric corrugated shelter, built-up steel, yellow trilingual nameboard, reddish tactile strip, water pipes, electrical lockers, OHE lattice portals.
3. Platform 1 interior photograph (Binoyjsdk, 18 Sep 2010): https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thiruvananthapuram_Central_Interior.jpg — actual pixels inspected: stone rear arcade, pale boxed columns, paneled ceiling, suspended red coach displays, dark and cream tiled paving. It is a platform arcade view, not a source for unknown booking-room geometry.

7. Kerala official SIA 2024: https://cmd.kerala.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Nemom-Terminal-English-Report-Final.pdf — TVC pitlines non-standard. Model maintenance details are visual reconstruction, not an exact pit survey.

Establishes separate booking function; does not supply measured floor plan.

Unknown room plans, ceiling heights, roof structure hidden by photographs, exact fixtures, platforms' Z, shelter bay spans and signal identities will be clearly identified as reconstruction. Functional spaces still modelled in full rather than omitted.

## Revision decisions after independent review
- Rail geometry is now a single unioned footprint per structural rail part, with real 45 mm flange channels cut alongside the 1.676 m gauge running faces. Head centres are ±0.872 m, head width 0.068 m, channel centres ±0.8155 m. Opposite checkrail centre offset 0.762 m with 0.062 m head width produces 45 mm clearance; ends flare away from the stock rail. Primary generic dimensional check: IRISET Signalling General §4.6.4, p46, https://nfr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/1567770997122-S8.pdf (44–48 mm range). These are visual standard-informed turnouts, not engineering-approved point assemblies.
- Moving tongue portions have separately editable 12 m taper regions following actual mapped branch paths. Mesh regions are partitioned, not duplicate coplanar rail-pairs.
- Trackside maintenance water mains/walkways follow mapped road geometry and reject segments too close to another track. No arbitrary straight above-rail pipes cross the fan.
- OHE portal extents derive from mapped electrified-track cross sections; outer legs are moved until at least 2.9 m centreline clearance against every mapped route. Intermediate legs use the same test.
- Footbridge landings have real 2.6 m safety-railing openings; roof and purlin cut-outs clear the stairs. Piers are on platform bodies, not inside track gauge. Workshops relocated outside all route corridors; their siting is explicitly reconstructed.
- First independent inspection passed eight actual-scene circulation rays (heritage entrance, platform passage, all six stair landings), found no train objects and confirmed three platform bodies. A subsequent physical rail correction is pending new scene/render verification.

## Map chronology caveat
Most raw mapped yard ways carry 2020 edit dates; some service roads were edited in 2023, approaches split/edited in 2024, platform tags edited in 2026. Edit dates are not construction dates. No historical OSM snapshot or railway engineering survey was recovered. The railway layout must therefore be labelled mixed-date map-derived, never an exact 2022 as-built. The architecture intentionally excludes current redevelopment.
