# V02 evidence and reconstruction ledger
The v02 gauge is exactly 1.676m between inner rail-head faces on straight sections.

The local filtered `references/osm_rail.json` is a derivative geographic dataset. Attribution: © OpenStreetMap contributors; https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright . Dataset licence: Open Database Licence 1.0, https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/ . OSM last-edit dates are not construction dates. Platform polygons were edited 2023–24; some route ways 2025–26. No historical snapshot was verified. Consequently this model is explicitly a 2017 photo-derived architectural reconstruction on a mixed-date mapped station yard, NOT a survey or verified 2017 as-built asset.

Actual derived map pixels were inspected before building. Four distinct polygons retain six faces: west PF1, island PF2/3, island PF4/5, eastern PF6. Their staggered ends and curved southern PF6 are preserved; they are not normalized to identical lengths. Rail paths, sidings and crossover connections use all adjacent map vertices; graph branch degree is computed across internal vertices as well as way endpoints. The regional ERSD marshalling/coaching depot1.5km away is a separate facility and is not silently collapsed into the station.

## Excluded future proposals
2022+ redevelopment architecture is not used as the 2017 facade. Platform extension proposals reported 2026 are not implemented as if as-built. Contemporary map geometry has an explicit mixed-date limitation rather than implied historical fidelity.

## Explicit reconstruction
Counter count/layout, room partitions, washrooms, office furniture, waiting seating, signs other than photo-derived identity, lamp/canopy spacing, bridge locations, detailed point machines/blades/frogs/checkrails, signal placement, workshop, utility distribution and surroundings are purposeful complete-model reconstructions. The connected mapped route centreline geometry does not certify every turnout frog geometry or operational interlocking as an engineering asset. Track component dimensions are realistic modelling targets. No rolling stock is included.

## Rights
No new licence is granted to generated scene, scripts, signs or renders. Retained photo-source attribution remains. Raw third-party photos are not redistributed. OSM-derived data and trace-based geometry retain their stated provenance/licensing obligations; generated asset rights are not asserted to override them. No endorsement or legal clearance is implied.

These references ground the 2017 architectural baseline, not a historical yard survey. Actual image pixels were inspected.

## Generated asset rights and reference-use limits
No new open-source or Creative Commons licence is granted for the generated `.blend`, geometry export, scripts, renders or sign artwork. The repository's existing no-open-source-licence default is preserved. The CC BY-SA notices above apply to the named third-party photographs only, not automatically to these generated files.

The photographs were used as visual reference; no photograph pixels are projected onto geometry or included in the model materials. The model interprets visible architecture with simplified 3D assemblies, photo-inferred dimensions, reconstructed materials, typeset signs, full mapped platforms and artistic component placement. Whether any particular reconstruction constitutes an adaptation, or requires additional permission, has not been legally determined. Attribution is not a claim of legal clearance. Raw reference photographs and crops are excluded from the deliverable; the source URLs remain for research/provenance.

Sign textures are original Pillow/RAQM typesetting. Malayalam and Devanagari glyphs use installed Noto Sans fonts, SIL Open Font License 1.1. English uses Noto Sans Bold.

## Physical turnout clearance reference
IRISET, Signalling General, section4.6.4, p.46: broad-gauge1.676m check-rail and wing-rail face clearances44–48mm. https://nfr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/1567770997122-S8.pdf . The visual reconstruction targets45mm normal face clearance; with60mm running heads and50mm check heads, check-rail centre inset is100mm. Longitudinal crossing cuts vary with crossing angle: (60mm rail head +2×45mm clearance)/sin(angle), so they are not a150mm lateral flangeway. The open switch toe requirement is a separate dimension. No railway engineering compliance is asserted.
